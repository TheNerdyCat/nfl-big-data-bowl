# NFL Big Data Bowl
Kaggle Competition - How many yards will an NFL player gain after receiving a handoff?

This solution placed in the top 9%, earning a bronze medal.

The competition used intricate player data to predict how many yards a run play will make. I implemented a neural network using Keras, to achieve a Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS) of 0.013262.
